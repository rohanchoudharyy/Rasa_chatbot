# Rasa_chatbot

## Objective:
Create a simple chatbot for the landing page of Olcademy which does the following: 
#### Ask the user about his/her basic information
#### Classify him/her as a student/instructor.
#### Collect his/her email id (with e-mail authentication)
## Skill Path: 
Python, Machine Learning algorithms, RASA NLU.
## Abstract:
There was no dataset used for this project, instead RASA NLU, an open-source natural language processing tool for intent classification, response retrieval and entity extraction in chatbots was used. Firstly, the chatbot confirms about how the user would use the platform (as a student or as an instructor) and then about their fields of interest. After this the bot asks for the user email and prompts for it until a valid email is entered and then it asks for the mobile number and checks its authenticity too. So basically, a ‘form’ comes into action where the slots are filled by user email and mobile number.
